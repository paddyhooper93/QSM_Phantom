Required materials:
•	Cyanoacrylic glue
•	Cast acrylic cylinder: 140 mm ID, 150 mm OD, 200 mm length.
•	Sheets of acrylic (minimum dimensions: 140 mm x 140 mm x 5 mm) 
•	O-ring flange fitting: O-ring: 145 mm ID, 155 mm OD (shore hardness = 90) to fit within O-ring groove
•	Fill-port: O-ring with outer diameter larger than 12 mm (shore hardness = 90) 
•	12-mm nylon bolt
•	20 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) vials
•	14 6-mm nylon bolts
•	All bolts were procured from RS components. Cast acrylic was procured from Foremost Plastics. NMR vials were procured from Merck and manufactured by Kimble Glass.
Outer body construction: The phantom was constructed with cyanoacrylic glue, cast acrylic cylinder and acrylic sheets. Cast acrylic was chosen since it was much more durable than extruded acrylic and does not create susceptibility artefacts. 
Flange fitting: The phantom was sealed with an O-ring flange fitting. The flange consisted of 12 6-mm tapped bolts to compress the O-ring within its groove. Each bolt was tightened at opposing ends to avoid pinching the O-ring.
Vial supports: Two machined acrylic plates (135 mm OD) acted as vial supports with 100-mm of imaging space in the z-direction. Small tags were machined from acrylic and glued to the cast cylinder to hold the plates. 
Air bubble trap: A single 6-mm hole was drilled on the top plate to remove bubbles from the imaging space. 
Fill port: The fill port was tapped M12 halfway between centre and edge and consisted of an O-ring wrapped around a 12-mm nylon bolt. The 12-mm bolt was tightened carefully to avoid pinching the O-ring.
