Instructions to the workshop
Required materials:
•	Cyanoacrylic glue
•	Cast acrylic cylinder: 140 mm ID, 150 mm OD, 200 mm length.
•	Sheets of acrylic (minimum dimensions: 140 mm x 140 mm x 5 mm) 
•	O-ring flange fitting: O-ring: 145 mm ID, 155 mm OD (shore hardness = 90) to fit within O-ring groove
•	Fill-port: O-ring with outer diameter larger than 12 mm (shore hardness = 90) 
•	12-mm nylon bolt
•	20 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) vials
•	14 6-mm nylon bolts
For full detail of the phantom, please refer to the engineering drawings themselves.

The phantom was constructed with cyanoacrylic glue, cast acrylic cylinder and acrylic sheets. 
Cast acrylic was chosen since it was much more durable than extruded acrylic and does not create susceptibility artefacts. 
The phantom was sealed with an O-ring flange fitting. 
Two machined acrylic plates were used as vial supports with 100-mm of imaging space in the z-direction. 
A single 6-mm hole was drilled on the top plate to remove bubbles from the imaging space. 
The fill port was tapped M12 halfway between centre and edge and consisted of an O-ring wrapped around a 12-mm nylon bolt. 20 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) vials (10 mm OD).
All bolts were procured from RS components. Cast acrylic was procured from Foremost Plastics. NMR vials were procured from Merck and manufactured by Kimble Glass.
